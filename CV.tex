\section{\textsc{Research Interests}}
\textbf{Exoplanets and compact objects astrodynamics} modeling and connecting theoretical models with observational results from next generation telescopes are my primary interests. I am also interested in incorporating \textbf{machine learning algorithms} in astronomical data analyses. 

\section{\textsc{Education}} 
\textbf{B.S. in Physics}, University of California, Los Angeles \hfill Expected 06/2017\\
Enrolled in Honors Program

The Square Kilometre Array(SKA) summer school  \hfill 06/2014\\

\section{\textsc{Research Experience} }
\textbf{Supernova Kicks in Hierarchical Triple System } \hfill UCLA \\
\textbf{Undergraduate Researcher,  PI: Smadar Naoz }  \hfill 11/2014 - Present\\
$\bullet$ Goal: examine the effect of supernova(SN) natal kick on hierarchical triple systems with analytical approach and apply the results to gravitational wave timescale\\
$\bullet$ Developed analytical constraints on maximum SN kicks to disrupt a triple system\\
$\bullet$ Predicted the post SN survival rate of BH-Neutron Star-Stellar companion triple system(and other compact triple systems eg. BH-BH system) with Monte Carlo method\\
$\bullet$ Developed Gravitational Wave timescale for BH-BH Stellar companion triple system

\textbf{Gravitational Lensing } \hfill UCLA\\
\textbf{Research Assistant,  PI: Tommaso Treu}  \hfill 07/2016 - Present\\
$\bullet$ Compile and manage an online database of lensed quasars for STRIDES collaboration, improved collaboration observation efficiency\\
$\bullet$ Attended NIRC2 remote observation on Keck telescope and assisted by reducing 2D raw image data with Professor Fassnacht's pipeline during the observation run\\
$\bullet$ Writing a python script to estimate the theoretical range of brightness of host galaxy given separation of lensed quasar images

\textbf{Physical Properties of Merging Galaxies in MOSDEF survey} \hfill UCLA\\
\textbf{Senior Thesis Project,  PI: Alice Shapley}  \hfill 09/2016 - Present\\
$\bullet$ Use Mosfire 2D spectrograph and HST images to study the physical properties of merging galaxies at z $\sim$ 2\\
$\bullet$ Use IRAF and shell script to process spectroscopy images to study merging galaxy properties
